## Introduction

In today’s competitive marketplace, customer satisfaction and loyalty are more than just performance indicators — they are critical drivers of long-term business success. For companies like OmniRetail, which operates in the fast-paced consumer electronics and smart home sector, understanding what makes customers satisfied, why they remain loyal, and where dissatisfaction is concentrated is essential to staying ahead.

This analysis explores customer feedback collected across multiple U.S. cities, focusing on satisfaction scores, loyalty levels, demographic trends, and customer interactions. Using Tableau, the project visualizes these insights through interactive dashboards that uncover:

- Which factors most influence satisfaction and dissatisfaction (e.g., Ease of Use, Packaging, Support Availability)

- How customer loyalty varies across age groups, gender, and purchase frequency

- Where loyalty and dissatisfaction clusters geographically, revealing region-specific performance trends

By turning raw survey data into actionable insights, this analysis equips business leaders with a deeper understanding of customer experience performance — enabling targeted improvements, stronger retention strategies, and more customer-centric decision-making.

## Visualization & Analysis:

### 1. Key satisfaction drivers

![](https://github.com/Cuteod/Customer-Satisfaction-and-Loyalty-Analytics-2024/blob/main/Satisfaction%20Patterns%20(1).png)

KPIs are:

- Avg Satisfaction Score: 5.35
- Low Satisfaction Rate: 41.67%

#### Factors Contributing to High vs Low Satisfaction Scores

The top causes of low satisfaction are:
- Ease of Use
- Features
- Brand Reputation

For high satisfaction, we have: 

- Packaging
- Product Quality

#### Customer Support Based on Satisfaction Factor

Customer support appears more as a reactive channel than a satisfaction driver. The presence of support contact is correlated with lower satisfaction and often signals underlying product or service issues (e.g., usability, features).

#### Does Customer Support Response Affect Loyalty

Loyal customers rarely need support: A cross-analysis shows that 24 high-loyalty customers tend to not contact support, reinforcing the idea that seamless experiences reduce the need for reactive support.

#### Repeat Purchases vs One-Time Buyers' Satisfaction

Repeat purchasers had a significantly higher average satisfaction score (5.62) than first-time buyers (4.98)

## Conclusion and Recommendation

This analysis has revealed critical insights into OmniRetail’s customer experience dynamics across satisfaction, loyalty, and regional performance. While overall satisfaction is moderate, a significant portion of customers report low satisfaction scores — often tied to issues with ease of use, product features, and brand perception. Loyalty, on the other hand, is influenced more positively by factors such as price and product variety, particularly among repeat purchasers.

Demographically, loyalty tends to be stronger among customers aged 36–40 and 46–50, while regional performance varies, with cities like Chicago, IL outperforming, and others like Los Angeles, CA, Phoenix, AZ, and San Antonio, TX showing lower satisfaction trends. Additionally, customers who contacted support were generally less satisfied, suggesting that support interactions are more reactive than reinforcing trust or satisfaction.

#### Recommendation:
1. Enhance Product Usability & Feature Clarity: Invest in UX improvements, clearer product documentation, and onboarding for complex products to reduce usability complaints — a key driver of dissatisfaction.

2. Proactively Address Support Triggers: Monitor common support issues related to features and brand reputation. Consider redesigning those pain points to reduce negative post-purchase experiences.

3. Leverage Loyalty-Driving Factors: Highlight price competitiveness and product variety in marketing campaigns. These are strong loyalty drivers and can be used to attract and retain high-value customers.

4. Focus on High-Potential Customer Segments: Tailor retention strategies to the 36–50 age group and repeat purchasers, who consistently show higher satisfaction and loyalty.

5. Target Low-Performing Regions with Localized Interventions: Deep-dive into underperforming markets (e.g., Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Antonio) to understand local issues and tailor service, delivery, or product offerings.

6. Shift Support from Reactive to Proactive: Train support teams not just to resolve issues, but to reinforce satisfaction. Consider follow-up calls/emails after support interactions to rebuild trust.
